# âž• project-euler

## ðŸ“ƒ Description:
My solutions to Project Euler problems, as well as other math-related algorithms/solutions.

The solutions to Project Euler problems in Python are within the ```/python``` directory. Each solution to each problem is contained within a directory in a ```main.py``` file, with the directory name being the problem name; eg: ```/python/longest-collatz-sequence```.  Source code to common mathematical problems/algorithms are contained within the ```/miscellaneous``` directory.
